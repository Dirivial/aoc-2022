# aoc-2022

Hopefully I will do the entire thing this year. I'm also using this as a tool to wake up earlier (problems are released at 6 a.m. my time)

## Running the files
If you want to run these files, some use only javascript while others use typescript. For javascript files (except day 4.js, it uses deno) just use "node x.js". For the other files, install deno if you haven't then run the file with "deno run x.ts" (a.js for day for).
